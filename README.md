Hey, it's Vivian.
I'm mostly an "artist" but I occasionally identify as a "developer" as well.
I mostly plan on working on drivers and programs for whatever weird hardware I try to use for virtual reality.
Honestly, I don't know how to code in anything more complex than Scratch or the occasional "sudo rm -rf /", but I'm willing to learn as needed.
Any input you may have on projects of mine would be greatly appreciated.
If for whatever reason you need to contact me, feel free to email me at vivialphadev@gmail.com, or message @vivialpha on Discord.
Alternatively, you can check out my [Carrd](https://vivialphadev.carrd.co/).
